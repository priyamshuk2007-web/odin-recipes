                is a French Provençal dish of stewed vegetables that was popularised in Nice and is sometimes referred to as ratatouille niçoise 
                Recipes and cooking times differ widely, but common ingredients include tomato, garlic, onion, courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant), bell pepper, and some combination of leafy green herbs common to the region, such as marjoram, fennel, 
                and basil, or dried bay leaves, thyme, or mixed herbes de Provence.</p>

                <p>This delicious summer vegetable stew is truly something. If 
                    you love fresh vegetables, grab them from your farmer’s market

                    and satisfying, yet wonderfully healthy and a favorite of my vegetarian friends. Want a pro-time? Be sure to pick up French bread to go with this iconic French dish! They pair wonderfully together.
