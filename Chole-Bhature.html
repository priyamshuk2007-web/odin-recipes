            <section><p>
                Chole Bhature is a classic and popular Punjabi meal of a spicy, tangy chickpea curry (chole) 
                paired with a soft, fluffy, deep-fried leavened bread (bhature). This hearty and indulgent combination of Chole Bhature is often enjoyed with pickles, onions,
                 and lemon and is a popular choice for breakfast or brunch across North India.
