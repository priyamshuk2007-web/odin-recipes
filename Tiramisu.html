            <section><p>Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine.
                Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina.

                <p>An emblem of Italian cuisine, spaghetti is frequently served 
                    with tomato sauce, which may contain various herbs (especially oregano and basil), 
                    olive oil, meat or vegetables. Other spaghetti preparations include amatriciana or carbonara. 
                    Grated hard cheeses, such as pecorino romano, Parmesan, and Grana Padano, are often sprinkled on top.
